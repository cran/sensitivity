
Changes in version 1.20.0:

  o New functions sobolrep() (Sobol' indices estimation based on 
  replicated orthogonal arrays) and sobolrec() (Recursive estimation 
  of Sobol' indices), which use the new functions addelman_const(),
  discrepancyCriteria_cplus() and maximin_cplus() (discrepancy and
  maximin criteria using a C++ implementation)

  o bootstrap implemented in sobolrank()
  
  o New function shapleyLinearGaussian() which computes Shapley effects
  for linear models with Gaussian inputs

    cost=sum(apply(U,1,function(u) round(Ntot/choose(p,sum(u))/(p-1))))

  o bug (caused by new R version 4.0.0) solved in:
    - sobolmartinez.R, base.R, morris.R, morris_oat.R and simplex.R
    (matrix objects now also inherit from class "array")
    - sobolMultOut.Rd, testmodels.Rd and delsa.Rd (screen devices 
    x11() should not be used in examples)
  
Changes in version 1.18.0:

  Analysis by transforming the output sample using  aspecific weight 
  function

  pvalue (independence test based on permutations), 3) new argument
  target in order to perform Target Sensitivity Analysis
  
  o New argument 'bias' in PLIsuperquantile(): "TRUE" gives the 
  previous computation; "FALSE" corrects this computation (the sample 
  points were not weighted by the likelihood ratio when computing the 
  perturbed superquantile)

    returned eigenvalues

    and sobolroalhs.R
    Examples that do not work have been put in \donttest{} (these
    examples work in practice)
    
    o Resolved bug in plot.soboljansen() and plot.sobolmartinez
    when dealing with matrice-type model outputs

    PLIquantile_multivar()
    
    o In the 3 PLI functions related to quantiles:
      - new arguments in order to have the PLI in percentage
      - the result also contains the perturbed quantiles values

    Export now the fcts, documentation entries in truncateddistrib.Rd
    
    o   Corrected bug: Replace \dontrun by \donttest in all Rd-files
    
    o   Corrected bug: package triangle is suggested and called in 
    PoincareOptimal.Rd
    
    o Function in sobolGPmethods.R and sobolpickfreeze.R have been 
    integrated in sobolGP.R
    
    o   Detected bug (not corrected) in tell.sobolGP() 
    Unused argument in km(), passed by eval(), update(), tell.sobolGP() ??)

    => comment in the example of sobolGP.Rd

    o   Functions shapleyPermEx() corrected (confidence intervals)
